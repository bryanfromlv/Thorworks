        <h1>Welcome to Thorworks!</h1>
        <article>
          <p>I am proud to announce that after months of hard work, thordarsen.net is now live.</p>
          <p>
            My main goal was to make my Forge of Empires tools available to everyone, especially my
            pride and joy <a href="https://thordarsen.net/gb_tracker/">GB Tracker</a>. This tracker
            has been a labor of love for over a year. While it is a very useful tool for those who
            play the 1.9 threads, it was an excellent opportunity for me to hone my web development
            skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many players will find other tools more to their liking. That is fine, I developed my
            tracker to do what I want within the constraints of time and labor available to me, and
            InnoGames outright refusal to provide any type of database interface or even a web API
            to access GB data. Therefore, to use my tool you have to manually input your GB data,
            such as level, goal, and position rewards. Fortunately, this is only necessary once as
            the data is saved to your browser's local storage.
          </p>
          <p>
            While this may seem daunting at first, I think if you give it a try you will find that
            the short amount of time it takes to enter your GB data is more than worth it for the
            time and errors it will save you while leveling your buildings. It is important to note
            that while the tracker works on mobile devices (better on tablet than phone) it was
            designed to be used on PC where it is easy to switch tabs while entering and updating GB
            data.The best use case is as I developed and use it, on PC with a dual monitor setup üòÅ
          </p>

            capabilities

            I developed this website mainly for the Forge of Empires tools, which I developed mostly
            for learning purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I" am Thordarsen, my game name for the past 20 years, AKA Alduins Twin in Noarsil
            (FoE).
          </p>
          <p>
            The story of my name is more extensive than one might think. When I was a teenager I had
            a very cool dog whose mother was my first dog, a purebred Collie. I named him Thordarsen
            J. Meissner. In those days I was starting my career in electronics and worked in a local
            repair shop fixing TV's and audio equipment. One of the main failures in TV's at that
            time was the "flyback transformer". Our main supplier for this part was a company named
            <a href="http://www.thordarsonmagnetics.com/" target="_blank">Thordarson Meissner</a>,
            which is still in business to this day.
